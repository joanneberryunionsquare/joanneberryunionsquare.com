<span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hello! 

I was born and raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry from Ohio Northern University. Through my alma mater, I managed to find a job as a research technician for a pulmonary stem cell lab at Boston Children's Hospital. This is where my Union Square story began. 

I had 12 hours to meet my roommate and find an apartment and we lucked out finding an affordable apartment at the top of Prospect Hill in Union Square. Fast forward one year and I met my boyfriend, Nick, at a mutual friend's wedding. As luck continued, I discovered he also lived in Union Square at the bottom of Prospect Hill! Our two dogs, Stormy and Demetri, love going on long walks over to the dog park at Nunziato field. Nick and I enjoy eating at all of the restaurants in Union Square and sampling the local breweries. Over the past 3.5 years as a Union Square resident, I have claimed this neighborhood as my physical New England foundation and have fallen in love with everything it has to offer. 

I want to preserve the integrity of this incredible community as the master developer, US2, introduces and moves forward with its plans for development and growth. With the Green Line Extension finally in motion, it is understandable that change will come to Union Square. I am confident though, through proper communication, planning, and respect for our community, Union Square will maintain the affordability and charisma that attracted me to this neighborhood fresh out of Ohio. 

I am a proud member of ABCDE, which is a platform of some of the Union Square Neighborhood Council Candidates, to continue to work together with USNC beyond the election.

ABCDE stands for:

*A*voiding displacement of our neighbors<br />
*B*uilding a strong membership base<br />
*C*ommunity benefit negotiations that hold developers accountable<br />
*D*emocratizing development so it benefits the many, not the few<br />
*E*valuating and advising on development proposals
