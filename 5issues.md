## 1. Affordability 

Currently US2 has proposed 20% affordable housing which will be broken up over 3 undisclosed income levels. That is simply not enough to meet the needs of our current and future community.

## 2. Green Spaces 

Several green spaces have been proposed throughout the redevelopment areas but US2 is already introducing buyouts in exchange for less green space. The community members have made it clear that more green space is desired, not less.

## 3. Fair taxes 

US2 details a 3:1 commercial to residential property tax rate. This is a smaller ratio than the 4:1 ratio in the Boston area. If wealthy commercial entities are moving into our neighborhood they should be held responsible for their fair share of taxes. Likewise, if the 3:1 ratio means commercial entities *are* paying their share, residents will be asked to pay *more* property taxes which reduces the feasibility of affordable housing.

## 4. Reasonable Development 

US2 describes their vision for Union Square as a "Kendall spillover". **We. Are. Not. Kendall. Square.** New architecture should be appealing and compliment the existing structures in our neighborhood.

## 5. Environmental Sustainability 

Somerville and the state of Massachusetts has a goal to be carbon free by 2050. In order to meet this goal we must build for the future. 

## 6. Minimal Displacement 

Homeowners and businesses have thrived in Somerville for decades. We should embrace them and include their existence in the plans for Union Square's future. To do this, we must respect affordable rent space for small businesses. This means adding an additional development group to consider in the plans proposed by US2. 

## 7. YOUR Questions and Concerns! 

Please do not hesitate to contact me and/or the council to include your questions and concerns regarding the future of our neighborhood.
