I have captured some of the images presented in the Coordinated Development Plan (CDP) proposed by US2. The tallest building will be 26 stories and directly block the Boston skyline view most residents who live on Prospoect Hill currently have. The CDP suggests Union Square will become a "Kendall Square spillover" which translates to laboratories, large apartment complexes, and medium to large scale tech start ups in the center of Union Square.

The parcels have already been zoned for future development, however, US2 does not yet own all of the parcels included in the projection plan. 

One particular parcel US2 does not yet own is the D1 parcel. This contains Ricky's Flower Market and the police and fire Station. The interest in demolishing the police and fire station without a plan to replace the structure is a large concern for Somerville Police and Fire Departments. This is a great example of the lack of community consideration US2 has included in this initial plan and why qualified members for Union Square Neighborhood Council are imperative in this process.

The main park proposed on parcel D1 will be 27,000 square feet. That is smaller than the size of a baseball field to put it into perspective. Lincoln Park is currently the largest park in Somerville and equates to roughly 12 times as big as this proposed space. The rest of the green spaces are split up in a fashion that has concerned citizens due to the proximity of those areas to main areas of car traffic. The intention to include green space is present, but USNC is committed to optomizing that potential.

Of course, these are all just proposals at this point. The Somerville Planning Board still has to vote to approve the special permit. The USNC needs to be established (elected and regularly meeting) before any development can begin. There is time to have input in the future of our neighborhood and voting for qualified candidates is crucial to making your voice heard. 

If you would like to read more information about US2's proposals, please refer to [Union Square Planning Coordinated Development Plan](https://www.somervillema.gov/departments/union-square-planning) for the detailed application and appendices US2 has submitted to the city of Somerville. 

I have read this all extensively and am happy to listen to and/or discuss questions and concerns you might have!
